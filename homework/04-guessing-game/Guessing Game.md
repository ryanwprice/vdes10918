# Guessing Game

## Instructions

Get Javascript to choose a random number between 1 and 9. 

Have the user choose a number, using the keyboard, and evaluate whether they guessed correctly or not.

## Bonus Round

Validate whether the key press is a number between 1-9. Provide an appropriate error message if the wrong key is pressed.

Display in the HTML whether the user was right or wrong, and if wrong, what the right number was.
