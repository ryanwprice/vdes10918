# Firebird Server (Blog) setup

If you need your login & password information, [email](mailto:ryan.price1@sheridancollege.ca?Subject=blog login &amp; password) me and I will dig up the info for you.

If you are having issues with setup, please contact [ ixd_support@sheridancollege.ca](mailto: ixd_support@sheridancollege.ca) for support.

_Note: If you are trying to upload images after setup, this will not work until a script has been run on the server side. If you are setting up your blog beyond Jan 31, please let me know so I can ensure the script is run for you._
