# Project 3 – Interactive App
Worth 30% 
Due: 14 (Week of Apr 23)

## Brief 
You will work in pairs, using the skills you have developed in Assignment 1 and 2, your project brief is to design a mobile web application for use away from traditional keyboard and mouse input, based upon the following themes:

**Project brief 1** – Enhance the experience of attending Comic Con

You will identify the users of this event and create a single-function app experience. Stay away from photo sharing, there are enough platforms that cater to those needs, instead focus on a unique problem of the event and how an app might solve this, such as wayfinding, food guide, traveling to and from, attending talks. You can ask your prof if you have a different event to have your project verified.

**Project brief 2** – Orientation App

You will identify a location that requires help in navigating in some way and you will come up with a unique solution to this problem, eg Canada’s Wonderland, Sheridan campuses, find my car (set geolocation when you park, so you can find it later), where’s the washroom, Tick off list of things you want to do at a place. You can ask your prof if you have a different event to have your project verified. 

**Project brief 3** – Utility App

Identify a utility such as creating a 'to do' list app, food tracker app (record what you’ve eaten in a day), geolocation weather app, direction app (take google maps API further to directions), workout calculator (set a run using a map, calculates distance, start/stop timer), geolocation movie app (brings back which cinemas are around you and what they are showing), pizza ordering app (customize toppings, then hit order), busy people dinner app (what you have in and what you can make with those ingredients), a nearby app (restaurants, café, travel), music suggestion app (user puts in what kind of genre they like, brings back new music suggestions, could work with YouTube or SoundCloud) or your own idea (talk to the prof to get it verified).

Your task is to create a cross-platform application using RWD (Responsive Web Design) that focuses on _one_ primary goal and focus on developing that alone.

Enhancements to consider for the mobile app include geolocation, API/JSON retrieval, built-in camera, and other mobile-specific elements.

When we move to creating a mobile app, this type of application has a totally different way of being interacted with and used, predominantly requiring finger movements, gestures and taps, the interface has to reflect the ability to do this. Remember you are not tied to a desktop and the app could be used _anywhere_. As such building an app is not simply dumping a website into a phone as apps have different use case scenarios and can access hardware functionality of the phone.

You will need to consider the purpose of the App and what value it adds to a given situation.

Mobile development takes into consideration tablet devices, but this project should focus on _small screen devices_ only. The screen real estate issues that you are faced with are a significant constraint which must be addressed in the design.

## Considerations

You will need to consider the purpose of the app and what value it adds to a given situation.

- What data will it provide? 
- How will you access that data? 
- Will it be embedded in the App or require web services?
- What is the 'Utility' value?
- How will this be used during the event?
- What phone features will you use, magnetometer, accelerometer, geo-location, camera, audio/video playback etc?
- Will there be longevity to engage after an event?

Please focus on one feature only for your App—the best Apps are simple. Stay away from users logging in as this is being built using web technology for use on the mobile web, and should not require a dedicated database. Users easily get confused if moving between too many screens, so keep your screens to an absolute minimum.

You probably will not be able to create the full App, however it must be created as a working prototype that demonstrates the core functionality.

## Deliverables

1. Finished working App project, uploaded to Firebird server and a URL submitted to Slate.
2. The code for your app zipped up and uploaded to Slate.
3. Demonstration of the App for presentation in class week 14

## Grading Criteria 

_All criteria are equally weighted_

1. Development of concept        
Quality of the original concept, developed into a final App. The idea should have changed according to user testing needs and in turn become a better digital resource 
2. Quality of the UI       
The visual look of the UI and the ability to perform the tasks required by the user, including the responsive qualities of the interface to interaction 
3. Technical problem solving         
Working with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Vue.js to build a functioning solution 
4. Professional approach         
Ability to problem solve both technically and aesthetically. Displaying a professional work ethic 

# DOCUMENTATION ASSIGNMENT 
Worth 20% 
Due: 14 (Week of Apr 23)

## Presentation

This documentation will be for the final group app project (above). Identify a suitable project from the list above, then develop Persona’s (identifying goals and needs). Develop this further into Scenario’s (user’s experience, where they are located and how they will use the App). Also create Site Maps, and a flow chart of the user tasks that the App will help the user to achieve. These tasks should then be sketched out as individual mobile screens with wireframe UI. These screens can be tested on users before writing a single line of code through paper prototyping of the design.

The process document must include:

- App Synopsis (Due Week 11)
- Personas & scenarios (Due Week 11)
- Site Maps (Due Week 11)
- Flow chart (Due Week 11)
- Wireframe (Due Week 11)
- Affordances of your App (Due Week 14)
- Paper prototypes (Due Week 14)
- Results of paper prototyping testing process documented (Due Week 14)
- Final UI design: Mockups, style tiles, etc. (Due Week 14)
- Any other materials you feel are relevant to the final working prototype (Due Week 14)

## Deliverables 

### Week 11

1. Required process documents (above), printed and ready for discussion in class.

### Week 14

1. All process documentation listed above, saved as a single PDF file of professional quality & aesthetically cohesive design, uploaded to Slate.

## Grading Criteria

_All criteria are equally weighted_

1. **Ability to identify App potential**       
Analyze existing Apps to generate a synopsis. Synopsis should include discussion of affordances and target users. This can been seen in the overall development of the UI (iterations from paper to digital, style tiles, mockups, etc.) 
2. **Develop supporting documentation**      
Required documentation is included and of professional quality
3. **Quality of visual presentation**       
Well designed documentation that demonstrates an ability to communicate complex ideas in a aesthetically cohesive design of professional quality. 
4. **Identify users**
Identify the users of the project and their needs. 
_A deduction of up to 5% may be removed for spelling and grammar issues._

## Late Work

All projects and exercises must be submitted at the beginning of the class on the date specified in the assignment brief unless otherwise stated by your professor. An assignment submitted within one week (5 business days) after the due date, will receive a 10% grade reduction. _Assignments more than one week late will not be graded_ unless a prior arrangement has been made with your professor.

If there is a valid reason for the late assignment, the student must email their professor as soon as possible, and no later than the date the assignment is due to indicate it will be late. If the reason is deemed to be valid, there will be no late penalty.

There will be no resubmission of work unless, under exceptional circumstances, this has been agreed to or suggested by the professor.

*PLEASE NOTE* - Computer hardware/software failure does not constitute a valid reason for a late assignment, please make regular back-ups of your work to ensure timely delivery of your project. Extra storage on [Dropbox](https://db.tt/KtXMYmmi) is available using this link.

## Academic Honesty

The principle of academic honesty requires that all work submitted for evaluation and course credit be the original, unassisted work of the student. Cheating or plagiarism including borrowing, copying, purchasing or collaborating on work, except for group projects arranged and approved by the faculty member, or otherwise submitting work that is not the student’s own violates this principle and will not be tolerated. Instances of academic dishonesty, including assisting another student to cheat, will be penalized as detailed in the Student Handbook.

Students who have any questions regarding whether or not specific circumstances involve a breach of academic honesty are advised to discuss them with the faculty member prior to submitting the assignment in question. For more info, see the Library’s Academic Honesty at Sheridan page.
