# Project 1 – DYNAMIC DATA INTERACTION
Worth 25%
**Due Week 5 (Week of Feb 6)**

## Brief 
You will develop an interaction design artifact–a simple calculator or random generator–using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that integrates user behaviour (e.g., clicking, hovering, touching, shaking, scrolling and dragging). Your task is to create an index.html file that Javascript is written into following page load. Your content should include text, graphics and animation to enhance the interaction. It must include at least 2 forms of user interaction (e.g., hover/transition techniques, inputs, variable requests).

Examples:
- Area or perimeter calculator
- Tip calculator
- Grade calculator
- Password generator
- Lottery ticket maker

_It is recommended that you run your idea past your instructor to ensure it fits the needs of the assignment._

## Deliverables

1. Blog post of the working project, discussing the project from conception to creation. The post should include:
	- discussion of problems encountered and the respective solutions
	- code snippets & screenshots to compliment your discussion
	- walkthrough of the final project.
2. The code for your page zipped up and uploaded to Slate.

## Grading Criteria 

_All criteria are equally weighted_

1. The project shows interesting intellectual ideas and concepts that have been developed and refined.	
2. Passion, heart and soul have been tirelessly applied to your work. This can be seen in the quality of the finished piece.	
3. The finished piece shows attention to detail, technical prowess, and overall superior craftsmanship.
4. Quality execution of code and documentation.

## Late Work

All projects and exercises must be submitted at the beginning of the class on the date specified in the assignment brief unless otherwise stated by your professor. An assignment submitted within one week (5 business days) after the due date, will receive a 10% grade reduction. _Assignments more than one week late will not be graded_ unless a prior arrangement has been made with your professor.

If there is a valid reason for the late assignment, the student must email their professor as soon as possible, and no later than the date the assignment is due to indicate it will be late. If the reason is deemed to be valid, there will be no late penalty.

There will be no resubmission of work unless, under exceptional circumstances, this has been agreed to or suggested by the professor.

PLEASE NOTE - Computer hardware/software failure does not constitute a valid reason for a late assignment, please make regular back-ups of your work to ensure timely delivery of your project. Extra storage on [Dropbox](https://db.tt/KtXMYmmi) is available using this link.

## Academic Honesty

The principle of academic honesty requires that all work submitted for evaluation and course credit be the original, unassisted work of the student. Cheating or plagiarism including borrowing, copying, purchasing or collaborating on work, except for group projects arranged and approved by the faculty member, or otherwise submitting work that is not the student’s own violates this principle and will not be tolerated. Instances of academic dishonesty, including assisting another student to cheat, will be penalized as detailed in the Student Handbook.

Students who have any questions regarding whether or not specific circumstances involve a breach of academic honesty are advised to discuss them with the faculty member prior to submitting the assignment in question. For more info, see the Library’s Academic Honesty at Sheridan page.
