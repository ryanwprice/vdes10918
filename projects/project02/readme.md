# Project 2 – Two dynamic features
Worth 25%
**Due Week 8 (Week of Mar 19)**

## Brief

Developing your skills from project 1, your task is to take two of the features from the code we have covered in class and create a simple web page/web app (it should have one primary goal) using two of the in-class concepts and merging them, or finding other dynamic data. You are simply finding a use case for the page based on code we have already created in class. 

Focus on usability is critical–the page/app must be intuitive, regardless of previous user experience. Instructions can be included, but strive to make the experience a success without having to read them. Affordances, conventions, and other usability fundamentals will help in the success of page/app's intuitiveness.

You will customize the design of your page and demonstrate it working.

You can pursue your own idea or one of the following: 

- Magic 8 ball
- Guessing games
- Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Coin flip
- Dice games
- Sleep calculator (research sleep patterns)
- Pet name generator (based on what pet user has)
- Restaurant Suggestor
- Colour scheme generator
- etc.

_It is recommended that you run your idea past your instructor to ensure it fits the needs of the assignment._

## Deliverables

- Demonstration of the working web page in a presentation.
- Blog post of the working project, discussing the project from conception to creation. The post should include:
	- discussion of problems encountered and the respective solutions
	- code snippets & screenshots to compliment your discussion
	- The project uploaded to the Firebird server
- The code for your web page zipped up and uploaded to Slate with URL to blog in the comments.

## Grading Criteria

_All criteria are equally weighted_

1. Ability to identify the web page potential
Analyze the feature and identify a group of users that need this feature (this should be addressed in the blog)
2. Develop supporting documentation 
Generate a blog post with your project uploaded/linked and a walkthrough with screenshots of the functionality 
3. Quality of visual presentation 
Create a well designed Web page that gives the right information and features to the user for the purpose of the project 

## Late Work

All projects and exercises must be submitted at the beginning of the class on the date specified in the assignment brief unless otherwise stated by your professor. An assignment submitted within one week (5 business days) after the due date, will receive a 10% grade reduction. _Assignments more than one week late will not be graded_ unless a prior arrangement has been made with your professor.

If there is a valid reason for the late assignment, the student must email their professor as soon as possible, and no later than the date the assignment is due to indicate it will be late. If the reason is deemed to be valid, there will be no late penalty.

There will be no resubmission of work unless, under exceptional circumstances, this has been agreed to or suggested by the professor.

PLEASE NOTE - Computer hardware/software failure does not constitute a valid reason for a late assignment, please make regular back-ups of your work to ensure timely delivery of your project. Extra storage on [Dropbox](https://db.tt/KtXMYmmi) is available using this link.

## Academic Honesty

The principle of academic honesty requires that all work submitted for evaluation and course credit be the original, unassisted work of the student. Cheating or plagiarism including borrowing, copying, purchasing or collaborating on work, except for group projects arranged and approved by the faculty member, or otherwise submitting work that is not the student’s own violates this principle and will not be tolerated. Instances of academic dishonesty, including assisting another student to cheat, will be penalized as detailed in the Student Handbook.

Students who have any questions regarding whether or not specific circumstances involve a breach of academic honesty are advised to discuss them with the faculty member prior to submitting the assignment in question. For more info, see the Library’s Academic Honesty at Sheridan page.
