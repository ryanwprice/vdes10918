# VDES10918 – INTERACTION DESIGN 2: NAVIGATION

## Overview

This project gives you the opportunity to build dynamic web pages that contain data that changes. As a result we will be using Javascript to update the page and control CSS to give the user updates. We will start simply but these will become web Apps, then eventually we will progress to creating an App for a mobile device, using the same knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS. HTML is the content, CSS is the design and JS becomes the behaviour or controls the page interactions.

## Communication

### Office Hours

My office time is split between B122D & J119. An appointment is necessary.

### Email

Make sure that you check your Sheridan email account regularly, as I may send any course updates and information to this account. You can setup your account to forward to your personal email account, so you never miss any relevant information. You should also setup your Slate email to forward to your Sheridan email as well.

I can be reached at [ryan.price1@sheridancollege.ca](mailto:ryan.price1@sheridancollege.ca) and will reply within 24 hours except on the weekends.

Emailing me the night before an assignment is due, will not likely get the desired response time, so stay on top of work to ensure your questions do not go unanswered.

## Software & Hardware

We will be using [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) to write HTML, CSS and JS.

Later in the term you will be using, Vue.JS a front end framework for easy update and manipulation of content on the page.

You will also learn the simple basics of [Adobe XD](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/xd.html), [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) and [Origami](https://origami.design/) as prototyping software.


A smartphone of some kind (iOS, Android, etc.) will be needed to test the final project.

## Grading

All assignments are to be completed for the start of class on the date assigned unless noted otherwise.

- Assignment 1 (25%) 
	- Simple Dynamic Data web page
	- Due WEEK 5 (Week of Feb 19)
- Assignment 2 (25%) 
	- Interactive Game 
	- Due WEEK 8 (Week of Mar 19)
- Assignment 3 (50%) 
	- Web App prototype
	- Due WEEK 11 (Week of Apr 9) & 13 (Week of Apr 23)

## Late Work

All projects and exercises must be submitted at the beginning of the class on the date specified in the assignment brief unless otherwise stated by your professor. An assignment submitted within one week (5 business days) after the due date, will receive a 10% grade reduction. _Assignments more than one week late will not be graded_ unless a prior arrangement has been made with your professor.

If there is a valid reason for the late assignment, the student must email their professor as soon as possible, and no later than the date the assignment is due to indicate it will be late. If the reason is deemed to be valid, there will be no late penalty.

There will be no resubmission of work unless, under exceptional circumstances, this has been agreed to or suggested by the professor.

**PLEASE NOTE** - Computer hardware/software failure does not constitute a valid reason for a late assignment, please make regular back-ups of your work to ensure timely delivery of your project. Extra storage on [Dropbox](https://db.tt/KtXMYmmi) is available using this link.

## Academic Honesty

The principle of academic honesty requires that all work submitted for evaluation and course credit be the original, unassisted work of the student. Cheating or plagiarism including borrowing, copying, purchasing or collaborating on work, except for group projects arranged and approved by the faculty member, or otherwise submitting work that is not the student’s own violates this principle and will not be tolerated. Instances of academic dishonesty, including assisting another student to cheat, will be penalized as detailed in the Student Handbook.

Students who have any questions regarding whether or not specific circumstances involve a breach of academic honesty are advised to discuss them with the faculty member prior to submitting the assignment in question. For more info, see Sheridan's [Academic Integrity](https://www.sheridancollege.ca/life-at-sheridan/student-services/library-services/academic-integrity.aspx) page.

## Learning Outcomes

To achieve the critical performance, students will have demonstrated the ability to:

1. Research and analyze interactive objects to identify elements and relationships.
2. Apply visual design principles to interactive problem solving.
3. Apply the terminology and principles of information architecture in interactive problem solving.
4. Produce process documents such as diagrams, briefs and storyboards.
5. Integrate project concepts into functioning interactions.
6. Apply design principles such as sequence and priority to solving interactive problems.
7. Integrate technical parameters and platforms into the development of design solutions.
8. Exhibit professional behaviours including:
	- openness to peer critiques
	- acceptance of differing viewpoints
	- willingness to work collaboratively
	- commitment to meeting project due dates
	- responsibility for self direction
	- commitment to the responsible use of reference materials.
