# Leap year

## Instructions

Determine whether any given year is a leap year or not.

A leap year, according to the Gregorian calendar, occurs:

- on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
- unless that year that is a new century (evenly divisible by 100)
- unless the century is divisible by 400

*For example*, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.
